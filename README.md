## Overview:
Clone the project and you can start.\
Don't worry about the database, EF Core will take care of everything.\
As a requirement you must have SQL Server and a manager such as SSMS to see the changes.

## Observations:
To test some endpoints it is necessary to register a user and then log in.\
When you log in you will be given a token.\
You will insert that token into a field that is found when you click on the green Authorize button (at the top) and you will have authorization to use some endpoints.
